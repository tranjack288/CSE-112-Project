# Workplan for Thursday, May 2 2024

## Our Definition of a Sprint
Due to the time constraints of having 5-6 weeks to complete this project, we are planning on having **weekly sprints**. This duration strikes a balance between providing enough time for meaningful progress and keeping the momentum high.

At the beginning of each sprint, we'll conduct a comprehensive sprint planning session. During this meeting, **we'll review the backlog, prioritize tasks, and collectively define the sprint goal**. Each team member will have the opportunity to voice their opinions and contribute to the planning process. We'll ensure that tasks are well-defined and achievable within the sprint timeframe.

Daily stand-up meetings will be scheduled for **10 minutes immediately before or after our lecture**. This timing is chosen to accommodate everyone's schedule and ensure that all team members can participate. These meetings will be focus on what each team member accomplished the previous day, what they plan to work on today, and any obstacles they're facing.

At the end of each sprint, we'll conduct a sprint review where we'll showcase the completed work to the whole group as well as our TA. 

Following the sprint review, we'll hold a retrospective meeting **to reflect on our processes and identify areas for improvement**. Each team member will have the opportunity to share their thoughts on what went well, what didn't, and any suggestions for making our next sprint even better. We'll use this feedback to iterate and adapt our practices continuously.
