## What we worked on this week:
Most of the work this week was catching up, a lot of work has been pushed to the following week.

1. **DONE**
    1. [Implement page to list and modify potential noodle ingredients](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/6):
    2. [Implement page to pick one noodle from suggested](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/25): need to combine with the layout. Essentially just a copy paste. Was combined with [this](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/6)

## Plan for next week:

Some tasks this week were pushed to the following week. Preparing the presentation and demo took longer than expected. Some of our team was also busy with other classes.

1. **NEW TASKS**  
    1. [Connect the front end and backend](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/30): This is a new tasks which bridges the gap between the front and backend. Such as sending the ingredients, getting the GPT generated recipie, and getting the DALLE generated image.
    2. [Make API calls to generate recipe and image](https://github.com/users/tranjack288/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=62558370)
    3. [Get API key](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/13)
    4. [Create a prompt where the user can override a valid ingredient](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/20): Another new tasks, the backend will verify that the list of ingredients is correct. This is done in the backend to ensure the values are correct and safe before entering into DALLE.
    5. [Fix layout of the questionnaire when screen is minimized i.e on mobile](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/26): new tasks since we noticed while testing that the layout on phone is not optimal.
    6. [Redesign result page to show generated recipe and image](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/7)
