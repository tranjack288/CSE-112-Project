# Workplan for Thursday, May 20 2024

## What we worked on last week:
We were able to progress more onto the website, most of the websites webpages are done. Although some webpages need to combined and pushed. 


2. **DONE:**
    1. [Define a list of default ingredients for each noodle](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/10): A list of the recommended noodles for each noodle.
    2. [Integrate Firebase into the existing CI workflow](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/27)
    3. [Define valid ingredients for user inputs](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/11): This is a list of ingredients that the user can choose to add/remove. This has been specified to allow for a better chatGPT/Dalle call for rendering the recipe/image
    4. [Implement shared page for showing ingredients and noodle Options](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/6):  This has been completed, although **still needs to be pushed**.
    5.  2. [Implement page to pick one noodle from suggested](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/25): This is a new issue created since this page was not included in our inital plans. Since this will share a lot of layout and page similarities with [issue #6](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/6). This issue will only be working on a div, which will later be pasted into the larger webpage. What has been implemented is a div which shows 4 closest noodles based on the previous survey questions. This issue is not completed yet, but is 90% done, as it just need to be combined with issue 6.  **still needs to be pushed**

1. **IN PROGRESS:** 
    1. [Implement page to list and modify potential noodle ingredients](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/6): This is still a work in progress. The basic layout of this page is shared between multiple pages, so that was completed. The Div which has all the ingredients and allows modification needs to be done. So, this task will be split into two issues. The issue that needs to be completed is listen below
        - [Implement page to list and modify potential noodle ingredients](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/28): This needs to be done

## What to work on this week:
 
We will finish up the tasks from last week by just putting them together. Then, we aim to add the last piece of the website which is the part which will generate the recipe, and the image and display them.

1. **TO FINISH** 
    1. [Implement page to list and modify potential noodle ingredients](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/28): the div which actually allows to list and modify ingredients needs to be added.
    2. [Implement page to pick one noodle from suggested](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/25): need to combine with the layout. Essentially just a copy paste.

2. **NEW TASKS** 
    1. [Rework the accessibility feature](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/16)
    2. [Rework the animations and transitions](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/4) 
    3. [Redesign result page to show generated recipe and image](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/7)
