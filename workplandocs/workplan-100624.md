# Workplan for June 10 2024, Final week

## What we worked on last week:

Finished up all our necessary tasks and decided certain tasks were not needed. We also spent some time polishing the repo such as finishing up the README, fixing any bugs we find while doing user testing. (Having a person try to break it as much as possible) Now that we have our final product, we also started hosting it on firebase.


1. **DONE:**
    1. [Connect the front end and backend](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/30): Complete the query to GPT and Dalle, standardize the way the backend and front end share information
    2. [Redesign result page to show generated recipe and image](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/7): connect with the backend to send the data and display the results
    1. [Rework the animations and transitions](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/4): rework to make it pretty
    2. [Make API calls to generate recipe and image](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/12): set up the actual api calls
    3. [Get API key](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/13)
    3. [Replace the name and profile pics on about us page ](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/15): replace the old teams about me with our team


2. **DISCARDED TASKS/FEATURES** 
    1. [Save previously generated recipes in a 'My Recipes' page](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/17): We decided that this was not necessary to the core functionality of our product. It was a feature that woudl be nice to have but would have multiplied the complexity of our product. We would need to make a "key" for each user and store their recipies on the back end. 
    2. [Rework animations and transitions](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/4): Instead of making this a seperate task, most of the reworks were done when doing the respective tasks. For example fixing the eye of the talking noodle on the front page. 
    3. [Modify the recipe after submission](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/8): This was a redundant feature since the user can just redo the survey if they wanted to change the recipie. 
    4. [Rework the accessibility feature](https://github.com/tranjack288/CSE-112-Project/issues/16): The accessibility feature is already acceptable, so reworking was more of polish than can be done if we had time.
